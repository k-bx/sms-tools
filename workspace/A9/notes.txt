clarinet tag:good-sounds, cello, naobo

Task 1.

    sounds = 
        [('clarinet', 'multisample', (0, 10)),
         ('cello', 'multisample', (0, 10)),
         ('naobo', None, (0, 10))]

I chose clarinet, cello and naobo. For clarinet and cello I've used "multisample" tag for better filtering, while naobo has no sounds with that tag, so I used none. I used duration up to 10 seconds just because it's stated in the task.

I used the "find tmp -name "*.mp3" -exec echo {} \; -exec afplay {} \;" bash command to check that sounds are good and they seemed to be.



Task 2.

First try:

- Number 10 is for lowlevel.spectral_contrast.mean.5

- Number 3 is for sfx.logattacktime.mean

Spectral contrast splits instruments into clarnet, naobo, cello (lowest to highest) very well, but for logattacktime.mean we see cello has two outliers. So overall not a bad pair, but could be better.

Let's change 3 to 5 having:

- Number 10 is for lowlevel.spectral_contrast.mean.5

- Number 5 is for lowlevel.spectral_contrast.mean.0

We see that while 5 by itself doesn't work that well, they work good together and visually form three separate clusters.



Task 3.

Used same params as before first (5 and 10). Got 88.33% accuracy because clarnet and cello got mixed at low and mean spectral contrast values.

Added 11 (mfcc), got a better result of 90% accuracy.



Task 4.

- http://freesound.org/people/ldk1609/sounds/56224/, k=3, descInput=[0, 12] (lowlevel.spectral_centroid.mean, lowlevel.mfcc.mean.1). Classified as clarnet.
- Same sound, k=3, descInput=[0] (lowlevel.spectral_centroid.mean). Classified as cello. It seams that by mean spector only our violin is near to cello rather than clarnet.
- http://freesound.org/people/MTG/sounds/355135/, k=5, descInput=[0]. Trying out different params, we can see that oboe is always classified as clarnet no matter how hard I tried. I guess they are similar indeed :)
