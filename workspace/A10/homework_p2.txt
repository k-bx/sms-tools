Chosen classes: violin, guitar, bassoon, trumpet, clarinet, cello, xiaoluo, daluo, flute, mridangam, xiaoluo

I took (0, 5) second interval everywhere. I've used "multisample" tag
everywhere where possible. Naobo, mridangam and daluo didn't have
enough sounds with that tag, so I've use None tags for them and it
worked well.

In order to do descriptorPairScatterPlot, I had to define more colors
in soundAnalysis.py, otherwise it crashed. Change was to make colors
list like this:

  colors = ['r', 'g', 'c', 'b', 'k', 'm', 'y',
            [.2, .7, .1], [.6, .3, .6], [.7, .2, .1]]

Launching the descriptorPairScatterPlot with different set of params
had shown that some descriptors work better for some sounds, some work
better for others.

Descriptors `0, 3`:

![0, 3](p2-img01-descriptor-0-3.png)

Descriptors `4, 8`:

![4, 8](p2-img02-descriptor-4-8.png)

Descriptors `10, 5`:

![10, 5](p2-img03-descriptor-10-5.png)

We can use these images to see which descriptors should improve our
clustering in future.
